# Loading Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Samantha:

```{r}
Somerville_data <- read.csv("/Users/samanthakotkin/Desktop/SDS192/project2/Somerville_Happiness_Survey_Responses.csv")
View(Somerville_data)
```

# Messing Around with Visualizations

```{r}
Somerville_data |> filter(Year == 2025) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Happiness.num)) + facet_wrap(vars(Household.Income), scales = "free") + geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
Somerville_data |> filter(Year == 2025) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Happiness.num, fill = Household.Income)) + geom_bar(position = "fill")
```


Potential Visualizations:

- heat map (for correlations between demographic info and happiness)
- histograms/bar charts (exs above)
- violin? for distribution across groups of happiness?


# Table Stuff

```{r}
Somerville_data |> filter(Year == 2025) |>
  select(ID, Gender, Age, Race.Ethnicity, Housing.Status, Highest.Level.Education, )
```
