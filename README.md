Authors: Sophia Mu, Samantha Kotkin, Daniella Quihuis-Granillo, Amanda Stein

Purpose: A repository for analyzing the Somerville Happiness Survey Responses Data Set in an Introduction to Data Science Course. 

Overview: In this repository, we analyze the 2025 responses to the Somerville Happiness Survey, which is conducted every two years by a random sample of residents in the City of Somerville to better understand their happiness, satisfaction, and well-being in relation to their City services. Our repository includes the files related to our data tidying, the data itself, exploratory analysis, and our overall analysis. Our data file includes a .csv file of our cleaned data set, our data tidying file involves removing variables that we did not analyze, our exploratory analysis involves creating tables and preliminary visualizations to demonstrate patterns we notice in our selected variables, and our overall analysis involves creating and explaining our final visualizations and how they help us to answer our research question of "How do the city services Housing Conditions, Sense of Community, and Education Quality relate to Happiness and Satisfaction, and do these associations differ across racial/ethnic and age groups?"
